The use the Jupyter Notebook and the javascript kernel to create sets of programming exercises that programming and mathematical concepts like:

* variables
* functions
* loops
* coordinate systems (cartesian, polar)
* physics

Then do exercises that are basically like the logo turtle, but in 3D and with a drone.

* Capstone exercise: Kids synchronized drone show
